## Insert number

```
Initialize list L = {60,65,75,80,90,95}
pointer to next node of the last node = NULL
n = first node
WHILE value of n < the number to insert DO
n = next node of n
END WHILE
value of node to insert = the number to insert
IF n = first node THEN
pointer to next node of node to insert = n
ELSE 
IF n = NULL THEN
pointer to next node of n = node to insert
ELSE
pointer to next node of the previous node of n = node to insert
pointer to next node of node to insert = n
ENDIF
ENDIF
```

选择头，尾和中间作为插入点来进行测试是为了测试算法的完备性和可靠性
